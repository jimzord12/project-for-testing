# Domain Decisions & Clarifications

This document records resolutions for points where the source documents
(`Psychological-Maturity-Questionnaire.DOMAIN.md`, `Psychological-Maturity-App.PRD.md`)
are silent or ambiguous. Per DOMAIN §17, these are **clarifications**, not changes to
question wording, answer order, score maps, rubric rules, or the AI prompt — so they do
**not** require a `questionnaire_version` / `scoring_version` / `prompt_version` increment.

Each decision names the governing source section, the resolution as implemented, and the
rationale. If a decision is later overturned, update the linked code and note it here.

## DD-1 — Structured Maturity Index when a dimension is `insufficient_data`

**Source:** DOMAIN §9.3 defines the Structured Maturity Index (SMI) only "When all five
dimensions are reportable." It does not define the value when one or more dimensions are
`insufficient_data`. PRD §14.2's example shows a numeric `structuredMaturityIndex`.

**Decision:** `structuredMaturityIndex` is `number | null`. It is `null` whenever any of
the five dimensions is `insufficient_data`; otherwise it is the equal-weighted, rounded
mean of the five normalized dimension scores. The index is never computed from a partial
set of reportable dimensions.

**Rationale:** Faithful to the literal "all five reportable" condition, and consistent
with the domain principle "confidence over false precision" (DOMAIN §4.5) — a single
aggregate computed from partial data would misrepresent its own certainty. Individual
reportable dimensions are still shown; the UI surfaces an "index unavailable — answer more
items in <dimension>" state (handled in the results-screen issue), not a fabricated number.

**Implemented in:** `src/domain/scoring.ts` (`scoreStructuredAssessment`),
`src/domain/result-types.ts` (`StructuredAssessmentResult.structuredMaturityIndex`).

## DD-2 — Narrative confidence when exactly one exercise meets its threshold

**Source:** DOMAIN §10.4 governs *scoreability*: both exercises meeting threshold →
scored; "either exercise fails its minimum-content threshold" → `limited_evidence`; both
skipped or below threshold → `not_scored` (never zero). DOMAIN §11.5 governs the separate
*narrative confidence* label: `High` (both meet), `Moderate` (one meets and the other
contains meaningful content), `Low` (only one short exercise contains useful content),
`Not available` (no scorable content). §11.5 does **not** define the case "one meets the
threshold and the other is empty/skipped."

**Decision:**

- **Score status** is determined solely by how many exercises meet their threshold
  (`meets`): `meets == 2` → `scored`; `meets == 1` → `limited_evidence`; `meets == 0` →
  `not_scored`. This is purely DOMAIN §10.4.
- **Narrative confidence** (DOMAIN §11.5) is reported as:
  - `high` when both exercises meet their threshold;
  - `moderate` when exactly one exercise meets its threshold — **regardless** of whether
    the other is meaningful or empty (a full exercise is present either way);
  - `low` when no exercise meets its threshold but at least one has meaningful content
    (this corresponds to a `not_scored` result and is exposed via the standalone
    `narrativeConfidence()` helper for display; it is never attached to a computed score);
  - `not_available` when there is no scorable narrative content.

**Rationale:** §10.4 and §11.5 are orthogonal axes (scoreability vs. confidence). Treating
"one meets, other empty" as `moderate` is the closest defensible mapping because the result
still rests on one full, threshold-meeting exercise. The §11.5 `low` band describes content
that never produces a score, so it lives on the standalone confidence helper rather than on
a `NarrativeScoreResult`.

**Implemented in:** `src/domain/narrative-rubric.ts` (`narrativeConfidence`,
`calculateNarrativeScore`).

## DD-3 — Profile balance when fewer than two dimensions are reportable

**Source:** DOMAIN §9.4 defines `profile_spread = max - min` over reportable dimension
scores but does not address the degenerate cases of zero or one reportable dimension.

**Decision:** `profileBalance` is `ProfileBalance | null`. It is `null` when no dimension is
reportable. With exactly one reportable dimension, `spread = 0` →
`relatively_balanced` (max equals min). With two or more, the standard formula applies.

**Rationale:** Spread is undefined without at least one score; `null` is honest. A single
score trivially has zero spread, which the existing bands already classify correctly.

**Implemented in:** `src/domain/scoring.ts` (`calculateProfileBalance`),
`src/domain/result-types.ts` (`StructuredAssessmentResult.profileBalance`).

## DD-4 — Confidence "loose consistency" deduction only on the 1↔5 extreme

**Source:** DOMAIN §11.3: normalize each item score to 0–100; "If a pair differs by more
than 75 points, subtract 5." Item scores are integers 1–5, normalized as
`((score - 1) / 4) * 100` → {0, 25, 50, 75, 100}.

**Decision (note, not a change):** The only pair difference that exceeds 75 points is the
0↔100 extreme, i.e. raw scores of 1 and 5 (difference 100). A 2↔5 pair is exactly 75 and
does **not** trigger the deduction (strict "more than"). The deduction applies only when
**both** items in the pair are answered with a score (NA / unanswered items are skipped).

**Rationale:** Direct reading of the threshold; documented to prevent a future "off-by-one"
regression toward `>= 75`.

**Implemented in:** `src/domain/confidence.ts` (`CONSISTENCY_PAIRS`, deduction loop).
